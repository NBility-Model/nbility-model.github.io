## Introduction

NBility is a comprehensive capability model designed for grid operators. It was developed to streamline collaboration within the utility sector and with the suppliers and advisors of grid operators. The NBility model comprises three key components:

* A capability model
* A related business object model
* A value stream model

The NBility model is actively maintained by the Dutch Distribution System Operators. Additionally, a User Group is being established to facilitate the exchange of experiences among users and to gather suggestions for future improvements.
