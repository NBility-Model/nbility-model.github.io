# Adding a new branch

To protect the integrity of the main branch and avoid overwriting updates from someone else, it is recommended to create a branch for each new piece of work.  Branches could be named by feature_[**topic name**] or fix_[**topic name**].  Branches can be created either through the coArchi plugin or via Github.com.

## Via the coArchi plugin

1. In Archi, select [**Toggle Branches View**] from the **Collaboration** menu.

2. In Branches Workspace, click on the [**Add branch**] icon.

3. Select [**Add branch and checkout**]. This will create the local topic branch and set it as the active branch. This action won't create the upstream branch (on [Github server](https://github.com/NBility-Model) yet).

4. The final step is to publish the new topic branch. This will make the new topic branch available on [GitHub.co](https://github.com/NBility-Model). To publish your new topic branch, select [**Publish changes**] from the **Collaboration** menu.

5. To ensure that your new topic branch have been successfully published, you can verify by visiting your topic branch on <https://github.com/NBility-Model> to see if your new topic branch appears in the specific repository you've worked on.
